## Installation

We are suggesting you to use composer, with the following: `php composer.phar require elephantio/elephant.io`. For other ways, you can check the release page, or the git clone urls.

## Usage

To use Elephant.io to communicate with socket server described as follow.

```php
<?php

use ElephantIO\Client;

$url = 'http://localhost:8080';
$client = new Client(Client::engine(Client::CLIENT_4X, $url));
$client->initialize();
$client->of('/');

// emit an event to the server
$data = ['username' => 'my-user'];
$client->emit('get-user-info', $data);

// wait an event to arrive
// beware when waiting for response from server, the script may be killed if
// PHP max_execution_time is reached
if ($packet = $client->wait('user-info')) {
    // an event has been received, the result will be a stdClass
    // data property contains the first argument
    // args property contains array of arguments, [$data, ...]
    $data = $packet->data;
    $args = $packet->args;
    // access data
    $email = $data['email'];
}
```

## Documentation

The docs are not written yet, but you should check [the example directory](https://github.com/ElephantIO/elephant.io/tree/master/example)
to get a basic knowledge on how this library is meant to work.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks goes to Mark Karpeles who helped the project founder to understand the way websockets works.
